# Agent-1 Summary for task-3

*Executive Summary:*
This initiative will configure BGP and MPLS settings across multiple devices in the Alpha network. 
It will enhance routing efficiency, enable label allocation, and establish BGP peering relationships 
to support scalable and resilient network operations.

*Engineering Summary:*
• A-ASBR-1:
   - Define route-policy for label-index
   - Configure BGP with specific settings
   - Advertise network with route-policy and labels
   - Establish BGP peering with neighbors
• A-ASBR-2:
   - Similar configuration as A-ASBR-1
• A-P-1, A-P-2, A-P-3, A-P-4:
   - Define route-policy for label-index
   - Configure BGP with specific settings
   - Advertise network with route-policy and labels
   - Establish BGP peering with neighbors using groups
• A-PE-1, A-PE-2, A-PE-3, A-PE-4:
   - Define route-policy for label-index
   - Configure BGP with specific settings
   - Advertise network with route-policy and labels
   - Establish BGP peering with neighbors using groups
• A-RR-1, A-RR-2:
   - Configure BGP with AS number and router ID
   - Establish BGP peering with specific peers
   - Enable route reflection and label sending
• Operational-Checks:
   - Various show commands for BGP, MPLS, and general information
