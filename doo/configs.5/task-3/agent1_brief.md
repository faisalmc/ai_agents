# Agent-1 Summary for taREMOVED3

*Executive Summary:*
This initiative will configure BGP AS 100 with IPv4 unicast/labeled-unicast on 6 devices (ASBRs, PE, RR). 
It aims to enhance core reachability, establish proper neighbor relationships, and enable route reflector functionality for scalability.

*Engineering Summary:*
• A-ASBR-1, A-ASBR-2:
   - Configure BGP AS 100 with IPv4 labeled-unicast
   - Use Loopback0 as update-source for core neighbors
   - Advertise specific routes with labels
• A-P-1, A-P-2, A-P-3, A-P-4:
   - Implement BGP AS 100 with IPv4 unicast
   - Use Loopback0 as update-source for neighbors
   - Configure route reflector functionality
• A-PE-1, A-PE-2, A-PE-3, A-PE-4:
   - Define BGP AS 100 with IPv4 unicast
   - Apply route-policy for labeled routes
   - Use Loopback0 as update-source for neighbors
• A-RR-1, A-RR-2:
   - Configure BGP AS 100 as Route Reflector
   - Use Loopback0 as update source for neighbors
   - Activate specific BGP neighbors
• Operational-Checks:
   - Various validation commands for BGP and MPLS monitoring
