connected IPv6 routes. However, the gateway of last resort is not set, which may indicate a lack of routing protocols or static routes for IPv6 traffic beyond directly connected networks.\n- ran: ['show bgp ipv6 summary'] \u2192 The output for 'show bgp ipv6 summary' is empty, indicating that there may be no BGP IPv6 sessions established or configured on the device. This aligns with the previous findings of no IPv6 routes available, suggesting potential issues with BGP configuration or neighbor relationships.\n- ran: ['show bgp ipv6 summary'] \u2192 The command 'show bgp ipv6 summary' resulted in an error due to invalid input, indicating that the command may not be supported on this device or in the current context.\n\nReturn JSON only with this exact shape:\n{\n  \"analysis_text\": \"<short plain analysis derived strictly from the outputs above>\",\n  \"direction\": \"<next diagnostic steps in plain English; no config>\",\n  \"recommended\": [\n    {\"command\": \"<read-only show cmd 1>\", \"tech\": \"bgp|interfaces|ospf|routing|misc\", \"trust_hint\": \"low\"},\n    {\"command\": \"<read-only show cmd 2>\", \"tech\": \"interfaces\", \"trust_hint\": \"low\"}\n  ],\n  \"execution_judgment\": {\n    \"<the command you just analyzed>\": \"ok\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  }\n}\n- The 'recommended' list MUST contain only read-only 'show' commands.\n- If the output indicates an invalid or failed command, set execution_judgment to \"error\".\n- Do not invent facts not present in the outputs.\n"
