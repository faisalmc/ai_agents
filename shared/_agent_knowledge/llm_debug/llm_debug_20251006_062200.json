This may affect routing for destinations not covered by these connected routes. Additionally, the BGP process is in an Active state and not exchanging routes, which could be related to the lack of a default route or missing policies for neighbors.\n- ran: ['show interfaces'] \u2192 The output shows that all interfaces except for GigabitEthernet0/0/0/4 and GigabitEthernet0/0/0/5 are up and operational. However, the BGP process is in an Active state and not exchanging routes, which may be related to the lack of a default route or missing policies for neighbors. The GigabitEthernet0/0/0/4 and GigabitEthernet0/0/0/5 interfaces are administratively down, which could affect connectivity if they are intended to be used.\n- ran: ['show ip bgp summary'] \u2192 The BGP process is in an Active state and not exchanging routes with the established neighbors 100.64.231.2 and 2620:fc7:64:231::2 due to missing inbound and outbound policies. This is indicated by the '!' next to the neighbor entries. Additionally, the BGP table state is Active, which suggests that it is not ready to send or receive routes.\n\nReturn JSON only with this exact shape:\n{\n  \"analysis_text\": \"<short plain analysis derived strictly from the outputs above>\",\n  \"direction\": \"<next diagnostic steps in plain English; no config>\",\n  \"recommended\": [\n    {\"command\": \"<read-only show cmd 1>\", \"tech\": \"<bgp|ospf|interfaces|routing|mpls|misc>\", \"trust_hint\": \"low\"},\n    {\"command\": \"<read-only show cmd 2>\", \"tech\": \"<one of the same categories>\", \"trust_hint\": \"low\"}\n  ],\n  \"execution_judgment\": {\n    \"<the command you just analyzed>\": \"ok\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  }\n} \n\nWhen deciding 'tech':\n- Use **bgp** for any BGP-related show commands (e.g., 'show bgp', 'show ip bgp summary', 'show bgp neighbors').\n- Use **ospf** for OSPF or IGP state commands (e.g., 'show ospf', 'show ip ospf interface').\n- Use **isis** for IS-IS or IGP state commands (e.g., 'show isis neighbor', 'show isis interface brief').\n- Use **interfaces** for link-level or interface-state commands (e.g., 'show interfaces', 'show ip interface brief').\n- Use **routing** for route tables or control-plane lookup commands (e.g., 'show route', 'show ip route summary').\n- Use **mpls** for MPLS or LDP-related commands.\n- Use **misc** if none of the above clearly apply.\n\nThe 'recommended' list MUST contain only read-only 'show' commands.\nIf the output indicates an invalid or failed command, set execution_judgment to \"error\".\nDo not invent facts not present in the outputs.\n"
