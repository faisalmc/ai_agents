Never recommend configuration mode commands.\nIf you believe configuration is needed, instead recommend a 'show' command that would validate the hypothesis.\nIf the output indicates an error (e.g., '% Invalid input', 'Unknown command'), your analysis_text should say so and execution_judgment must be 'error' for that command.\nBe concise and practical.\n\nHere are the command outputs:\n\nCOMMAND: show isis neighbors\nOUTPUT:\nshow isis neighbors\n\nFri Oct  3 02:56:30.968 UTC\n\nNo IS-IS instances found\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:B-ASBR-1#\n\n\nRecent triage history (last 3 steps, for context only):\n- ran: ['show bgp ipv4 unicast summary'] \u2192 BGP is in an Active state and operating in STANDALONE mode.
