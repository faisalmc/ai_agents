This aligns with the previous findings that BGP is in an Active state and operating in STANDALONE mode, suggesting that route exchange is not occurring.\n- ran: ['show bgp neighbors'] \u2192 The BGP neighbor 2.0.101.10 is in an Idle state due to 'No route to multi-hop neighbor', indicating a potential connectivity issue. The neighbor 100.64.231.2 and 2620:fc7:64:231::2 are established, but there are no accepted prefixes, suggesting that route exchange is not occurring due to missing policies.\n\nReturn JSON only with this exact shape:\n{\n  \"analysis_text\": \"<short plain analysis derived strictly from the outputs above>\",\n  \"direction\": \"<next diagnostic steps in plain English; no config>\",\n  \"recommended\": [\n    {\"command\": \"<read-only show cmd 1>\", \"tech\": \"<bgp|ospf|interfaces|routing|mpls|misc>\", \"trust_hint\": \"low\"},\n    {\"command\": \"<read-only show cmd 2>\", \"tech\": \"<one of the same categories>\", \"trust_hint\": \"low\"}\n  ],\n  \"execution_judgment\": {\n    \"<the command you just analyzed>\": \"ok\" | \"partial\" | \"error\"\n  }\n} \n\nWhen deciding 'tech':\n- Use **bgp** for any BGP-related show commands (e.g., 'show bgp', 'show ip bgp summary', 'show bgp neighbors').\n- Use **ospf** for OSPF or IGP state commands (e.g., 'show ospf', 'show ip ospf interface').\n- Use **isis** for IS-IS or IGP state commands (e.g., 'show isis neighbor', 'show isis interface brief').\n- Use **interfaces** for link-level or interface-state commands (e.g., 'show interfaces', 'show ip interface brief').\n- Use **routing** for route tables or control-plane lookup commands (e.g., 'show route', 'show ip route summary').\n- Use **mpls** for MPLS or LDP-related commands.\n- Use **misc** if none of the above clearly apply.\n\nThe 'recommended' list MUST contain only read-only 'show' commands.\nIf the output indicates an invalid or failed command, set execution_judgment to \"error\".\nDo not invent facts not present in the outputs.\n"
